### IM Send Protocol (MANDATORY when user asks to send a message to WeCom/Feishu/DingTalk)

**Trigger**: Any request that involves sending a message to an IM platform (企业微信/WeCom、飞书/Feishu、钉钉).

**Execute this exact sequence - no deviations:**

#### Step 1 - Identify how the user is talking to you

Check your system prompt for a `## Current IM Channel Context` block:

| System prompt contains | Meaning | Action |
|------------------------|---------|--------|
| `## Current IM Channel Context` block present | User is chatting via an IM channel (Feishu/WeCom/DingTalk). The block contains the current Session ID and platform. | Use that Session ID as the **pre-selected default** -> skip to Step 4, unless the user explicitly asked to send to a different session |
| No such block | User is chatting via **Flocks Web UI** - this is NOT an IM session. You do NOT have a target session ID yet. | Proceed to Step 2 |

#### Step 2 - Discover sessions (only if Step 1 found nothing)
Call `session_list(category="user", status="active")`.
Filter results to sessions whose `title` starts with `[Wecom]`, `[Feishu]`, or `[Dingtalk]`.

If no IM sessions found -> stop and tell the user:
> 未找到活跃的 IM session。请先在企业微信/飞书/钉钉中向 Flocks 机器人发送任意消息以建立 session。

#### Step 3 - Ask user to pick a session (ALWAYS, unless session already resolved above)

Use the `question` tool. Build options from the discovered sessions, and always append an "我不知道" option at the end:

```
question([{
  "question": "您想要向 IM 中的哪个 session 发送消息？",
  "type": "choice",
  "options": [
    // one entry per discovered IM session:
    { "label": "<session title>", "description": "<session_id>" },
    // always append this last:
    { "label": "我不知道" }
  ]
}])
```

**After the user answers:**

| User selected | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| A specific session | Use that option's `description` as `session_id`, proceed to Step 4 |
| "我不知道" | Stop. Reply to the user: "如果您不确定是哪个 session，请先在群聊里 @机器人 发一条消息，例如：「你的 session id 是什么」，机器人会回复对应的 session id，然后再告诉我。" Do NOT proceed to send. |
| User already gave an exact session ID | Skip Step 3 entirely, proceed to Step 4 |
| User named a platform but no session ID | Show only sessions for that platform |

#### Step 4 - Map title prefix to channel_type

| Title prefix | channel_type |
|--------------|--------------|
| `[Wecom]`    | `wecom`      |
| `[Feishu]`   | `feishu`     |
| `[Dingtalk]` | `dingtalk`   |

#### Step 5 - Send

```
channel_message(session_id="<id>", message="<content>", channel_type="<type>")
```

#### Step 6 - Report
- Success: confirm which session/platform received it.
- Failure: show the error; suggest checking bot connectivity.

### IM Session Resolution for task_create (MANDATORY)

**Trigger**: User asks to create a scheduled or queued task whose action includes sending a message to an IM platform.

Before calling `task_create`, you MUST resolve the target IM session id and embed it into the task `description`. The task runs unattended - it cannot ask the user at execution time.

**Protocol (run BEFORE task_create):**

1. Follow **Steps 1-3 above** to resolve `session_id` and `channel_type`.
   - If the user selects "我不知道" -> stop. Do NOT create the task. Tell the user they must provide a session id first.
2. Once resolved, embed both values into the `description` field:

```
task_create(
  title="...",
  description="... 发送到 IM channel_type=<wecom|feishu|dingtalk> session_id=<id>",
  ...
)
```

3. Also include them in `user_prompt` so the executing agent can parse them:

```
user_prompt="向 <platform> session <session_id> 发送消息：<message content>"
```

**Why this is required**: The task executor runs in a new session with no user present. Without the session_id baked in, it cannot ask - and will silently fail or send to the wrong target.
